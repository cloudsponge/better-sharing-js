# better-sharing-kickoff-labs.js

BetterSharing adds a better way to send email referrals by creating a form that you can add to your [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com/) campaign.

## Installation

Add this HTML content to the page to specify where the form should be added, otherwise, we'll pick a place for you:

    <div class="bettersharing-inline-email-form"></div>

Add the script to your page:

    <script
        src="https://unpkg.com/@cloudsponge/better-sharing-kickoff-labs.js"
        data-key="[YOUR_KEY_FROM_CLOUDSPONGE]"
        crossorigin="anonymous">
    </script>

## Configure CloudSponge & Zapier

See the [better-sharing.js project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudsponge/better-sharing.js) for information on how to set up email sending via the Contact Picker Zapier app.
