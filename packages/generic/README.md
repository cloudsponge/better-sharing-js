# better-sharing.js

Better Sharing adds a better way to send email referrals by creating a form that you can add to any page.

## Installation

Add this HTML content to the page to specify where the form should be added:

    <div class="better-sharing-inline-email-form">Better Sharing will load here. üîß Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by CloudSponge.</div>

Add the script before the closing `</body>` tag on your page:

    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/@cloudsponge/better-sharing.js"
      data-key="[YOUR_KEY_FROM_CLOUDSPONGE]"
      data-sender-email="support@cloudsponge.com"
      data-default-sender-name="Better Sharing"
      data-subject="you will like this"
      data-body="This is a sample referral email. The link below will take you to my rewards page!"
      data-referral-link="https://www.example.com/"
      crossorigin="anonymous">
    </script>


Optionally, configure your betterSharing object with more options:

    <script>
      betterSharing({
        // switch to the deep links version of the plugin
        contactPickerButton: {
          deepLinks: true,
          title: 'Invite people directly from your address book.',
        },
        cloudsponge: {
          sources: ['gmail', 'yahoo', 'outlookcom'],
          skipSourceMenu: true,
        }
      })
    </script>

## Supported options

Options may be set in the `script` tag using `data-` attributes or via the call to `betterSharing({})`.
